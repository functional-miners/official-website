# Hello *Nerd!*

We are **all** computer science *nerdz*, right?

For sure you know what are *research papers*. I am sure that you have read a couple of those related to *computer science*. If you are carefully watching that community, you are aware of the idea called [PapersWeLove](http://paperswelove.org).

If not - don't worry, I will explain: *it is a repository of academic computer science papers and a community who loves reading them*.

We would like to do exactly the same thing as a part of *Functional Miners* community. We would like to once in 2 months meet together for a talk about one particular research paper and facilitate discussion about that topic. It is a great idea to get familiar with something new, and maybe even change your career direction. Those meetings will be interleaved with *Functional Miners* events.

**Why we have not created a new chapter/user group?** Because our *Silesian* community is already too fragmented, and spawning another group will not help. But we are open to any participants - no matter the programming language or paradigm you like. In the end, we are all *computer scientists*, right?

Below you can find our official logo. If you are interested and would like to give a talk, please reach out to us via our [contact form](/#contact) or directly to the one of the [organizers](/organizers).
