# Hello *&lambda;!*

**Functional Miners** was an IT meet-up organized in *Silesian* region, for people interested in *computer science* topics oriented around *distributed systems*, *functional programming*, *functional languages*, and *programming languages theory* in general. Also, we were organizing a [reading club](/book-club) around the topics mentioned above and [*Computer Science Nerdz*](/computer-science-nerdz) meetings in a *PapersWeLove* formula.

**For now, we do not plan any further events as the initiative is temporarily suspended**.

In the past, we usually met on the **3rd** or **4th Tuesday** on monthly basis, interleaving *Functional Miners* and *Computer Science Nerdz* meetings. Event started at *<time>5:30 PM</time>*, and talks around *<time>6 PM CET / CEST</time>*.

## Newsletter

Back in a day, we had a *meetup.com* group. However, due to their aggressive pricing politics, we have suspended it and moved all our members into a typical email list.
