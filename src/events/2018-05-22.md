      title="Raft Consensus Algorithm"
      abstract="To meet the growing expectations of availability and efficiency of our services, we tend to design and launch them in a distributed environment. It's simple for stateless applications, but for the others we have to reach a 'consensus' - multiple processes need to agree on the overall state. On this presentation I will talk about the publication 'In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm', that describes the Raft algorithm, and how it can be used as a starting point to solve advanced problems in a distributed environment."
