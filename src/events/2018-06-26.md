      bio="I graduated as a computer engineer from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics, then I was working for several years in academia on distributed storage solutions (in Python and C++). Then as a freelancer I was working for small unsuccessful startups (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Clojure). Nowadays I'm mostly working on educational games (Unity 3D, C#) and iOS apps for graphic design (Objective-C, Swift)."
      title="Comparing imperative and functional approaches in Swift"
      abstract="This talk compares the imperative and functional solutions to process some JSON data. That includes code comparison, but also CPU and memory comparison on an iPhone - everything using the Swift programming language."

      bio="I am a seasoned JavaScript developer trying different paradigms and approaches to problem solving. Experiments with variety of languages only makes these tries more often and unpredictable. As newbie Scala developer I can verify all my experiences in a completely new environment."
      title="FP vs. OOP"
      abstract="Object-oriented programming and functional programming are always presented as completely different approaches. In my presentation I will present basics and standard patterns in both paradigms to give an answer to question whether they are so different or not really."
