      bio="Michal started programming in Erlang over 10 years ago when working on his Masterâ€™s project prototyping massively multiplayer online games. He is currently a Technical Lead at Erlang Solutions. In 2014 he started to co-organise the Lambda Days conference in Krakow. He concentrates on distributed systems, teaches Erlang and speaks at conferences."
      title="Exploring BEAM-based systems with erlang.pl"
      abstract="For a few years we've been playing with an idea of visualising Erlang nodes and processes in a way that would help developers quickly grasp the behaviour of a cluster or a node. Today's web browsers support WebGL, which can be used for rendering interesting user interfaces. In this talk we present examples of visualisations of inter-node traffic within an Erlang cluster, a supervision tree busy with after-crash restarts, a set of processes involved in message passing between them."

      bio="Programmer with 5 years of experience. At the top of IT priorities list puts communication. When doing that for money tries to solve more problems than he creates. With pet projects it is usually the opposite. ;)"
      title="And even you can have Elm in producation!"
      abstract="If you are hesitating from introducing Elm into your project, you don't want to pick a new technology, you are afraid that it will be too big an investment, change of infrastructure, language or architecture is totally impossible - you are in the right place! We will talk about how to introduce Elm into your production application EVEN TOMORROW. You will not believe how easy it is!"

      title="Functional Programming in Serverless World"
      abstract="Serverless is getting more and more attention in today's world. Ease of use, promise of infinite scale and reducing operational complexity to the minimal level - those are only the few of selling points of that particular 'technology'. Unfortunately, we have limited choice when it comes to the languages and runtimes available in those environment. If you are interested how much yak shaving, frustration and unnecessary work is required to bring our favorite functional flavors to the Serverless world - that talk is for you! And I can promise that at the end, I will not leave you without reproducible and reliable solution."
