      title="On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism"
      abstract="Modern programming languages are becoming increasingly complex and full of features. To get a better understanding of them, it's worth going back to some basics of languge theory: how type systems affect daily programming, what's the elemental difference between using abstract data types and object-oriented programming, or what are the pros & cons of various kinds of polymorphism. Thoose aspects are content of the publication 'On Understanding Types, Data Abstraction, and Polymorphism' by L. Cardelli & P. Wegner, which will be presented during the meeting."
