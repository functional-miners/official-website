## Dependencies

Download `node` in version `v6.3.1`, together with the newest possible `npm`. Then look [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) how to install `yarn` on your *OS*. After that install `gatsby` globally:

```bash
~ $ yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

## Running in development mode

```bash
~ $ gatsby develop
~ $ yarn run develop
~ $ npm run develop
```

## Serving and Publishing

First you will need to build the pages:

```bash
~ $ gatsby build
~ $ yarn run build
~ $ npm run build
```

Then you can serve those locally:

```bash
~ $ gatsby serve
~ $ yarn run serve
~ $ npm run serve
```

Or deploy anywhere you would like to.
